* goal
  * methods to install webpack
* [![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/webpack.svg?label=webpack&style=flat-square&maxAge=3600)](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/releases)

## Prerequisites

* fresh version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
  * current Long Term Support (LTS) release is an ideal starting point
  * if you use older versions -> You may run into a variety of issues
    * Reason: 🧠 may be missing functionality webpack and/or its related packages require 🧠

## Local Installation

* if you use webpack, ONLY for bundling (NOT include | production build)-> install it with `--save-dev`

  ```bash
  npm install --save-dev webpack
  # or specific version
  npm install --save-dev webpack@<version>
  ```

* else -> install it via

  ```bash
  npm install webpack
  # or specific version
  npm install webpack@<version>
  ```

* if you're using webpack v4+ & want to call `webpack` -- from the -- CL -> install the [CLI](/api/cli/)

  ```bash
  npm install --save-dev webpack-cli
  ```

* 👁️recommend it for MOST projects 👁️
  * Reason: 🧠 easier to upgrade projects individually 🧠

* typically, it's run -- via -- >=1 [npm scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts) / look for a webpack installation | your local `node_modules` directory
  * you can access its binary version | `node_modules/.bin/webpack`

  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "build": "webpack --config webpack.config.js"

    // if you are using npm v5.2.0+ -> run `npx webpack`
    "build": "webpack --config webpack.config.js"
  }
  ```


## Global Installation

```bash
npm install --global webpack
```

* **NOT recommended**
  * Reason: 🧠 locks you down to a specific version of webpack 🧠

## Bleeding Edge

* == install the latest versions / offered by webpack
  * may still contain bugs

  ```bash
  npm install --save-dev webpack@next
  # or a specific tag/branch
  npm install --save-dev webpack/webpack#<tagname/branchname>
  ```

* **NOT recommended** to use | production
