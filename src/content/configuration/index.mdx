* webpack will ⚠️ NOT require you a configuration file ⚠️, BUT by default
  * `src/index.js`   --  entry point of your project
  * `dist/main.js`   --  path | output the result / minified & optimized for production
* [createapp.dev](https://createapp.dev/webpack)
  * := online tool -- for -- creating custom webpack configurations
  * how does it work?
    * select various features / are combined    &   added | resulting configuration file
    * generates an example project
      * -- based on -- provided webpack configuration
      * / you can
        * review | your browser
        * download
* `webpack.config.js` file
  * must be placed | root folder
  * automatically use it -- by -- webpack

## Use a different configuration file

* `--config`
  * flag to use different configuration file / situations

  **package.json**

  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "build": "webpack --config prod.config.js"
  }
  ```

## Set up a new webpack project

* TODO:
W> webpack applies configuration defaults after [plugins defaults](/contribute/writing-a-plugin/#configuration-defaults) are applied.

Webpack has a huge set of options which might be overwhelming to you, please take advantage of [webpack-cli's `init` command](/api/cli/#init) which could rapidly generate webpack configuration files for your project requirements, it will ask you a couple of questions before creating a configuration file.

```bash
npx webpack init
```

npx might prompt you to install `@webpack-cli/generators` if it is not yet installed in the project or globally. You might also get additional packages installed to your project depending on the choices you've made during the configuration generation.

```bash
$ npx webpack init

[webpack-cli] For using this command you need to install: '@webpack-cli/generators' package.
[webpack-cli] Would you like to install '@webpack-cli/generators' package? (That will run 'npm install -D @webpack-cli/generators') (Y/n)
